### Theory: 
In the experiment, we worked with continuous and discrete signals. A signal that varies smoothly and continuously over time is referred to as a continuous-time signal. These signals represent a quantity of interest that is influenced by an independent variable, usually considered as time. A discrete-time signal is a sequence of values of interest, where the integer index can be thought of as a time index, and the values in the sequence represent some physical quantity of interest.
The step signal or step function is that type of standard signal which exists only for positive time
and it is zero for negative time. If a step signal has unity magnitude, then it is known as unit step
signal or unit step function. It is denoted by u(t).
The unit impulse signal has zero amplitude everywhere except at t = 0. At the origin (t = 0) the
amplitude of impulse signal is infinity so that the area under the curve is unity. It is denoted by
Œ¥(t).
A ramp function or ramp signal is a type of standard signal which starts at ùë° = 0 and increases
linearly with time. The unit ramp function has unit slop. It is denoted by r(t).
Any signal can be plotted using MATLAB. To plot any given signal the conditions should be
applied to fulfill the given criteria.

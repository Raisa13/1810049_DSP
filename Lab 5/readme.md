### Experiment Name: Experiment on finding the Z-transform and inverse Z-transform of a function.

### Theory:
The Z-Transform is an important tool in DSP that is fundamental to filter design and system
analysis. It will help you understand the behavior and stability conditions of a system.
A mathematical technique called the Z-transform is used to translate differential equations in the
time domain into algebraic equations in the z-domain.
An extremely helpful tool in the analysis of a linear shift invariant (LSI) system is the Z-transform.
Difference equations are used to model an LSI discrete time system. These time-domain difference
equations are solved by first converting them into algebraic equations in the z-domain using the
Z-transform, manipulating the algebraic equations in the z-domain, and then converting the results
back into the time domain using the inverse Z-transform. 

The Z-transform formulaX(z) = X(z)=∑_(∑n=-∞)^∞▒〖x[n]Z^(-n) 〗

The method of determining the time domain signal x(n) from its Z-transform X(z) is known as the
inverse Z-transform. The symbol for the inverse Z-transform is-

                                 x(n)=Z^(-1) [X(z)]
